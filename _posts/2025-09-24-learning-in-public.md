Writing this feels scary, knowing that my words will soon be public. Yesterday, I've talked myself into an experiment and made a pact with my learning buddy [Janina Nemec](https://digitalcourage.social/@IsItArtOrTrash): I'll find a platform where I can share my learnings and, what's more likely, my questions and struggles.

This is the first step delivering my promise. Thank you Janina for keeping me accountable.
